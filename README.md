Developed with Unreal Engine 5

To build the project you will need to have Unreal Engine installed on your computer.
We used Unreal Engine 5.3.2 for developing this project.

Once you have all the project files, you will need to open the project in Unreal Engine and go through a series of steps to package the project into an executable file (for Windows) or other file type for other platforms.

This video shows the entire process for packaging a .exe file:

Further documentation on the packaging process can be found within these pages on the Unreal Engine website:

Following along with the video should enable you to package a .exe file of this project.

If there are any issues with the code or build process, it may be necessary to resolve them in your IDE.  We used Visual Studio 2022, but others may be suitable.
